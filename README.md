The application shows the equipment losses & death toll of russians in 2022 - during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War II. All data is official. 

A lot of civilians and children have already been killed by russian troops. Ukraine is in war flame and under missile attack now. We are strong. Stand with Ukraine. #StandWithUkraine, @StandWithUkraine

## Description

Using this application, you may check and track the enemy losses for a particular date/day of war:

* Personnel
* Armored Personnel Carriers
* Multiple Rocket Launchers
* Aircrafts
* Anti-aircraft warfares
* Drones
* Field Artilleries
* Fuel Tanks
* Helicopters
* Military Autos
* Naval Ships
* Tanks

## Acronyms

* MRL - Multiple Rocket Launcher;
* APC - Armored Personnel Carrier.


## Personal observations during development

* Launch screen loads as designed only when a picture used in any its UIImageViews is of JPG format (not vector or PNG)
* Text Hyphenation for Ukrainian words works good only when the language of a device is set to Ukrainian. In comparison, when itâ€™s set to English (US/UK), justified text with system default hyphenation looks awful, because it stretches the space between letters (not words).
